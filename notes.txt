Reducers:
- Function that gets called with 2 objects.
- Argument #1: object that has all of our state in it.
- Argument #2: object that describes the update we want to make.
- We look at argument #2 and use it to decide how to change argument #1.
- 2 technicalities: 
    (1) We never change argument #1 directly. 
    (2) We must always return a value to be used as Argument #1 (eg: state)
- type: String that describes the exact change operation we want to make.
- payload: Some data that is critical to the change operation.

Layout:
- Box object model
- Flex Box
 - Default: alignItems: 'stretch' (stretchs and takes up as much horizontal space as possible)
  - Flex direction (default is column), justify content...default is flex-start (controls how children lay themselves out)
 - Parent: alignItems, justifyContent, flexDirection || Child: flex, alignSelf
    - flex makes a child in a parent try to take up as much space as possible. Go to flex values lesson for more info.
    - alignSelf overrides the child element alignment
- Position
    - position: 'relative' is default
    - absolute; ignored by sibling elements but adheres to parent flex instructions
- top, bottom, left, right
    - shifts it that direction, overlapping the other element if there are any
- Anytime we want an element to fill up its container
    - set element to absolute (ignores sibling elements), set top, left, bottom, right as 0.
