Reducers:
- Function that gets called with 2 objects.
- Argument #1: object that has all of our state in it.
- Argument #2: object that describes the update we want to make.
- We look at argument #2 and use it to decide how to change argument #1.
- 2 technicalities: 
    (1) We never change argument #1 directly. 
    (2) We must always return a value to be used as Argument #1 (eg: state)
- type: String that describes the exact change operation we want to make.
- payload: Some data that is critical to the change operation.
